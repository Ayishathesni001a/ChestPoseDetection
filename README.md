# Human Pose Detection on Chest X-rays

This project is designed to detect human poses in chest X-ray images. It uses deep learning techniques for pose estimation and can help analyze potential abnormalities in the thoracic region of chest X-rays.

## Project Overview

The model detects human body keypoints from chest X-ray images. These keypoints are useful for detecting anatomical abnormalities, especially in the thoracic area. The model uses pose detection algorithms to identify positions such as joints, limbs, and body alignment.

## Dataset

This project uses a dataset of **chest X-ray** images that contain both normal and abnormal thoracic conditions. If you're using a publicly available dataset, mention it here. For example:
- **Dataset**: [VinBigData Chest X-ray Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinbigdata/chest-xray-abnormalities)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Clone the Repository
